## My projects
### ⌨ [Type](https://github.com/dark7void/Type)  
1443 loc written in [go](https://github.com/golang/go)  
Discord bot to measure your typing speed at a keyboard. Not something I would recommend, but some Discord bots like this were very popular in some servers. I don't use Discord anymore, nor I develop it.
### 📑 [Bookmarks](https://github.com/dark7void/Bookmarks)
281 loc written in [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)  
A simple tool for saving short text, URLs, or else, for terminal and GUI.
### 🐧 [Auto-Artix](https://github.com/dark7void/Auto-Artix)
53 loc written in [bash](https://github.com/bminor/bash)  
My personal post-install for the Cinnamon Artix distro. It refreshes the keyrings and installs programs and config. You wouldn't be able to use the distro if you don't use it, it's very annoying.
### 🎧 [Auto-Bluetooth](https://github.com/dark7void/Auto-bluetooth)
\>10 loc written in several languages  
Small script that checks for Bluetooth pairing, and connects to the MAC of a headset. I did it because my last distro didn't automaticly connect to the paired headsets, for some reason.
